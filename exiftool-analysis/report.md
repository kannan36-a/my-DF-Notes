## 🧠 Inference
- The metadata indicates the image has been processed/edited (GIMP 2.10.24 and Adobe Premiere Pro recorded in metadata).  
- Multiple history entries and "History Action: saved, created, saved" suggest the file has undergone edits and possibly composite operations.  
- **File type vs extension mismatch** (internal type = JPEG but file is named `.png`) is suspicious and should be highlighted in your analysis — it can indicate conversion, renaming, or tampering.  
- Conclusion: **Not an untouched original**; evidence strongly suggests post-processing/manipulation.
